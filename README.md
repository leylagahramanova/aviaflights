I completed this project as my graduation thesis at the National Aviation Academy. 
This final project presents an application for processing user and flight simulator data. 
The application allows for modifying, adding, and modifying data. Access to user data is restricted to the administrator. 
The application also includes statistical functionality, enabling analysis of problem types and their frequencies in various simulators. 
Filtering by flight simulator, date, and users is possible, allowing identification of which user encountered which problem in a specific flight simulator.
I used:
 MySql to manage the database;
 Node.js was chosen for interacting with it;
 React.js (Redux) for user interface;
 Material-ui, Bootstrap and Bulma for stylizing;
